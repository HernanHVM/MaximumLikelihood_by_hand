# MaximumLikelihood_by_hand
Felsenstein ML pruning algorithm and pulley brlens optimization "by hand" Rscript using the Lewis 2001 Mk model.
It uses the expm package to get the P matrix from a Q matrix.

First portion of the Rscript is the pruning algorithm, the second portion is the pulley optimization.
All written by HVM for my Systematics class @UNAM.
Most #comments are in Spanish for obvious reasons as it was written for Mexican students.
