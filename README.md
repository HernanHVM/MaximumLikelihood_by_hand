# MaximumLikelihood_by_hand
Felsenstein ML pruning algorithm and pulley brlens optimization "by hand" Rscript using the Lewis 2001 Mk model.
It uses the expm package to get the P matrix from a Q matrix.

First portion of the Rscript is the pruning algorithm, the second portion is the pulley optimization.
Instead of using 0s and 1s for the Mk model, my Rscript uses emojis as character states (heart/coraz√≥n <3 and smiley_face/sonrisa :) ) respectively, as states can be represented by any symbol, although computers only accept numeric values (0,1,2, etc.).

All written by HVM for my Systematics class @UNAM.
Most #comments are in Spanish for obvious reasons as it was written for Mexican students.
